## Project Details

This Python-based Task Manager application allows users to manage a list of tasks. It offers functionality to:
- Add a new task.
- View all the tasks currently in the system.
- Update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- Exit the program gracefully when done.

The app runs in the terminal, allowing users to input task details and perform the desired operations. It serves as a basic introduction to Python-based applications for task management.

For an in-depth look at the code, I’ve shared screenshots of the code in PDF form and .py file
